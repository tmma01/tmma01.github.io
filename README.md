I am a sophomore at Stevens Institute of Technology pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science (GPA: 3.98) with a strong focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the Explainable and Controllable AI Lab, where I work on mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs) for safer and more explainable AI under Dr. Zining Zhu. Through my research, I have learned that LLMs are beyond just "Black Boxes"; by reverse-engineering the internal components of machine learning models, researchers can begin to truly understand the role of the inner workings of AI systems. My dream is to reverse-engineer the mind itself, working on the mind-body, AI alignment, and superintelligence problems along the way.
